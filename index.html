          <h2>About me but not</h2>
          <p>Horticulture is the branch of agriculture that deals with the art, science, technology, and business of growing plants. It includes the cultivation of medicinal plants, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, herbs, sprouts, mushrooms, algae, flowers, seaweeds and non-food crops such as grass and ornamental trees and plants. It also includes plant conservation, landscape restoration, landscape and garden design, construction, and maintenance, and arboriculture. Inside agriculture, horticulture contrasts with extensive field farming as well as animal husbandry.

          Horticulturists apply their knowledge, skills, and technologies used to grow intensively produced plants for human food and non-food uses and for personal or social needs. Their work involves plant propagation and cultivation with the aim of improving plant growth, yields, quality, nutritional value, and resistance to insects, diseases, and environmental stresses. They work as gardeners, growers, therapists, designers, and technical advisors in the food and non-food sectors of horticulture. Horticulture even refers to the growing of plants in a field or garden.</p>

          <h2>Jimma University</h2>
          <p>Jimma University (JU) is a public higher educational institution established in December 1999 by the amalgamation of Jimma College of Agriculture (founded in 1952), and Jimma Institute of Health Sciences (established in 1983).The two campuses are located in Jimma city 352 km southwest of Addis Ababa with an area of 167 hectares.
          JU is Ethiopia's first Innovative Community Oriented Education Institution of higher learning. The University adopted the city's name for logically sound reasons. For one thing, Jimma is one of the biggest cities in the country noted for its coffee production. Secondly, Jimma was the seat of the King of the Five Gibe States during the 19th century. The Main Campus is situated in the neighborhood of the ex-palace of Aba Jifar, now an open museum. Jimma is known among other things for its year round green attractive landscape scenery and coffee production as mentioned above.</p>
